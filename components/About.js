            <h5>I am an aggressive Grand Exchange merchant based in Varrock. I target individuals with high levels of sympathy and cash. By continuing my merchant business, I ensure the traditions long-passed throughout Runescape history stay alive. As a professional "Street Merchant", "Thug", "Hustler", or "Dirty Rat Scammer", I keep Runescape players on their toes when on the internet, and teach valuable lessons to younger players.</h5>
